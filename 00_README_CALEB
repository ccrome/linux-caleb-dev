This is a linux 4.5 kernel tree that runs a dummy loopback SSI driver
on the wandboard (and probably other boards too!)

This tree has modifications to the SSI port by Caleb Crome and Arnaud
Mouchie. We'll work on getting these mods into the linux mainline
eventually.  

To make you do:

you can use the file 'mkf' here for making things:

Here's how to get started:

ARCH=arm
CROSS_COMPILE=/home/caleb/linux/gcc-linaro-5.3-2016.02-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-
make imx_v6_v7_defconfig

the mkf file assumes you're running the wandboard ubuntu 15.10 release
from here:
http://www.wandboard.org/images/downloads/ubuntu-15.10-lxde-wandboard-20151106.zip

Edit the mkf file to your needs

Then you can do
# make -f mkf menuconfig
to configure things.  Almost nothing is required I think

# make -f mkf zImage modules dtbs
# make -f mkf zCopy modulesCopy dtbsCopy

When you modify the kernel, you can just do whichever of the above
things you need, like 
   # make -f mkf zImage zCopy reboot 
To make a new kernel and copy it over and reboot all in one go.
